今天我们的午饭是  
西葫芦煮通心粉  
有一个意大利小孩  
端着它,想起了  
家乡米兰的晚风
  
今天我们的晚饭是  
胡萝卜鸡肉盖饭  
还是那个意大利小孩  
对着它,捏着鼻子  
把胡萝卜全挑出去  

在埃德蒙顿附近酒店隔离时作  
  
  
A poor Italian kid  
  
Today our lunch was:  
tomato squash pasta.  
There's an Italian kid.  
The feeling of Milan's wind,  
blew through his mind.  
  
Today our dinner was:  
turnip fried rice.  
That poor Italian kid,  
threw away all the food,  
with his nose pinched.
